# üí¨ FinBERT-Powered Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how to use **FinBERT**, a pre-trained transformer model specialized in financial sentiment analysis, to classify news headlines and financial text. The goal is to identify whether a given piece of text expresses **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment within the financial domain.

## üîç Project Overview

Traditional sentiment analysis models often struggle with the nuance of financial terminology. **FinBERT**, a domain-specific variant of BERT, is fine-tuned on financial data to address this gap.

In this project, the notebook walks through:

- Loading a dataset of financial headlines or sentences  
- Preprocessing the text for transformer-based models  
- Using **FinBERT** (via Hugging Face Transformers) to classify sentiment  
- Parsing and storing results for downstream use or visualization  

This setup is ideal for analysts or developers looking to build sentiment-aware financial tools, dashboards, or models.
